## Question

I used following code to pull a github branch:
git clone --branch branch_name git@github.com:enterprise_name/repo_name.git

After I pull this github branch, I committed several changes locally. 
How to create a new branch and push all changes to new one

Here is my detailed command
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
git checkout -b new_branch_name
git push -u origin new_branch_name
git branch -r
```
Please firstly repeat the original command and explain the rough description of command

## Answer (from GPT)

Here's the original command you used:

```bash
git clone --branch branch_name git@github.com:enterprise_name/repo_name.git
```

### Description of the command:
- **`git clone`**: This command is used to make a local copy of a remote repository. You are cloning a specific GitHub repository.
- **`--branch branch_name`**: This option tells Git to clone a specific branch (`branch_name`) from the repository, instead of the default branch (typically `main` or `master`).
- **`git@github.com:enterprise_name/repo_name.git`**: This is the SSH URL to the repository, which specifies the repository location and its enterprise GitHub URL.

In summary, this command clones a specific branch (`branch_name`) from a GitHub repository (`repo_name`) hosted on an enterprise GitHub account (`enterprise_name`).

Now, let's break down your second part of the process where you're creating a new branch and pushing your changes.

### Detailed Explanation of Your Commands:
```bash
git status
```
- **`git status`**: Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area. It lets you see which files have been modified, which are staged for the next commit, and which are untracked.

```bash
git add .
```
- **`git add .`**: Adds all modified and untracked files in the current directory to the staging area, preparing them for commit.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```
- **`git commit -m "Your commit message here"`**: Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message explaining what was changed.

```bash
git checkout -b new_branch_name
```
- **`git checkout -b new_branch_name`**: Creates a new branch (`new_branch_name`) and switches to it immediately.

```bash
git push -u origin new_branch_name
```
- **`git push -u origin new_branch_name`**: Pushes the newly created branch and all committed changes to the remote repository (`origin`) and sets it as the upstream branch. The `-u` flag establishes a tracking relationship between the local branch and the remote one, so future `git push` commands can be simplified.

```bash
git branch -r
```
- **`git branch -r`**: Lists all remote branches in the repository, allowing you to confirm that your new branch is successfully pushed.

---

This sequence of commands allows you to make changes to a GitHub repository, commit them, create a new branch, and push that branch to the remote repository.

## Question

How to fetch the another branch and merge into ```new_branch_name``` branch
```
git checkout new_branch_name
git fetch origin main_branch_name
git merge origin/main_branch_name
```

## Answer (from GPT)

Here is your original command:

```bash
git checkout new_branch_name
git fetch origin main_branch_name
git merge origin/main_branch_name
```

### Description of Each Command:

```bash
git checkout new_branch_name
```
- **`git checkout new_branch_name`**: Switches your working directory to the `new_branch_name` branch. This ensures that you are working on the correct branch where you want to merge changes into.

```bash
git fetch origin main_branch_name
```
- **`git fetch origin main_branch_name`**: Fetches the latest updates from the remote repository (`origin`) for the branch `main_branch_name`. This only updates the local tracking branch without merging the changes into your current branch.

```bash
git merge origin/main_branch_name
```
- **`git merge origin/main_branch_name`**: Merges the changes from the fetched branch `main_branch_name` (from the remote repository `origin`) into the currently checked-out branch, which is `new_branch_name` in this case. It will attempt to integrate changes from the main branch into your local `new_branch_name`.

### Summary of the Workflow:
1. You first switch to the `new_branch_name` branch with `git checkout`.
2. Then you fetch the latest changes from the `main_branch_name` on the remote (`origin`) using `git fetch`.
3. Finally, you merge the fetched updates from `main_branch_name` into your `new_branch_name` branch using `git merge`.

This ensures that `new_branch_name` contains all the latest changes from the `main_branch_name` after the merge.
